 I took data straight from the Masters Official Website, and added it onto Excel files.
 
 From there, I imported it into Python, where I did an analysis of all the data.
 
Some insights I was able to find include the lowest score in a round, the lowest overall score and the player with the most Masters Victories. 

As someone who has enjoyed watching Golf for many years, I was very interested in this dataset, and took alot out of it.
