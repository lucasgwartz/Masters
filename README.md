I recently took on a fun project where I gathered data from the Masters.com website—almost as exciting as watching the final putt on the 18th green! I carefully transferred the data into Excel and then analyzed it in Python.

During this hands-on experience, I discovered some incredible insights, like who has the lowest round score, which player has the most Masters wins, and the tournament’s all-time lowest score. As a golf fan, working with this data was super rewarding! It felt like uncovering the rich history of the Masters.

I also keep the Masters Winners list updated each year, and I can't wait to see what other stories this dataset will reveal!
